This is one of the oldest projects I have a worked on.

It is website written back in 2012 in php + html + css as a project for high school graduation exam.
Functionalities are limited: the idea was to realize an e-commerce portal, but, since it is only a demo-website, it is not possible (obviously) to buy anything.
